                                       How’s our Earth now? What happen to our mother nature? Our world is moving towards advancement with fast pace of technologies development.
                                       As a result, our lives are far more convenient and better in quality compared to the pass. However, as the world keeps on advancing towards prosperity, the condition of mother nature is progressing negatively.
                                       People are slowly neglecting and thus losing the awareness towards the natural environment. EARTH IS NO LONGER AS HEALTHY AS IT SHOULD BE! Actions such as pollutions, deforestation, illegal hunting, overfishing,
                                       and so many more are impacting the mother nature and brought negative effects including global warming, ocean acidification, climate change, etc. All these effects not only harming the eco-system and lives of the living creatures,
                                       they are affecting humans too!
                                       <br><br>
                                       In short, our irresponsible behaviour caused a chain reaction, which, in the end, the consequences came back to us, suffering us and other innocent living creatures for our own actions. THIS MUST BE STOPPED!
                                       <br><br>
                                       As Scouts, we should take the lead and begin with ourselves, setting well examples for others to learn and follow. If not now, WHEN? If not us, WHO?

                                      <p> Action speaks louder than words. With that being said, the first challenge of the week is to create a poster to increase the Awareness towards the Environmental Protection.

                                        7)	Any positive effects if we start doing ‘the right thing’br
