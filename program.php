          <p> This year has not been an easy one for all of us. Small businesses were affected,
            thousands of lives were lost, school was cancelled, and many of our long-term plans for the year were put on hold.
            How did 2020 impact you? Create a short film on what 2020 has taught you, your hopes and dreams for the rest of
            the year, or a reenactment of this year itself. As long as it is according to the theme,
            let your ideas roam freely! <br><br>
            1)	DURATION:<br>
            	●	The total runtime of the short film must be twelve (12) minutes. This includes the beginning and ending credits. <br>
            2)	LANGUAGE:  <br>
              ●	Bahasa Malaysia, English, Mandarin languages are accepted.  <br>
              ●	Subtitles in English are compulsory. <br>
            3) TOPIC SENSITIVITY: <br>
              ●	All films cannot contain any sensitive subjects such as religion, race and politics. Vulgarities and inappropriate clothing are not allowed. <br>
            4)	COPYRIGHT: <br>
